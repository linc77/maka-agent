# Maka Code Bug / Flow Audit - 2026-05-22

Owner: @xuan  
Thread: #my-ai:02c56cb6  
Scope: current Maka code, runtime/main/renderer/core/storage/settings surfaces. Layout work is tracked separately by @yuejing.

## Fixed on main

### 1. Shell safe-prefix commands bypassed Ask prompt

Commit: `778077d Fix runtime failure states and shell permission gaps`

Evidence:
- `packages/core/src/permission.ts` categorized safe-prefix commands before checking generic shell control operators.
- Commands like `echo hello > out.txt`, `cat package.json | wc -l`, `pwd && npm test`, backticks, and `$()` could be treated as `shell_safe`.

Impact:
- Ask/Explore mode could auto-allow command forms that mutate files, chain commands, or expand secret-bearing command substitutions.

Fix:
- Added `SHELL_CONTROL_PATTERNS` and classify those commands as `shell_unsafe` before safe-prefix matching.
- Regression tests added in `packages/core/src/__tests__/permission.test.ts`.

### 2. Backend build/send failure after user append left false session state

Commit: `778077d Fix runtime failure states and shell permission gaps`

Evidence:
- `packages/runtime/src/session-manager.ts` appended the user message and turn running state before backend creation, but backend build failures happened before the active stream bookkeeping/finally state transition.

Impact:
- A persisted user message could be left with a running/active session instead of a failed/blocked turn.

Fix:
- Wrapped connection lock, backend build, stream bookkeeping, and backend send in a single try/finally.
- Catch appends failed turn state and final header becomes `blocked/unknown`.
- Regression test added in `packages/runtime/src/__tests__/session-manager.test.ts`.

### 3. Renderer stale message refresh could overwrite current chat

Commit: `778077d Fix runtime failure states and shell permission gaps`

Evidence:
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx` `refreshMessages(sessionId)` always called `setMessages(await readMessages(sessionId))`.

Impact:
- If the user switched sessions while an async read was in flight, the old session could overwrite the active chat view.

Fix:
- Guard `setMessages` with `activeIdRef.current === sessionId`.

### 4. Streaming / permission UI could remain stuck after error/abort/complete

Commit: `778077d Fix runtime failure states and shell permission gaps`

Evidence:
- Error and abort events refreshed sessions/messages but did not consistently clear streaming text or pending permission dialog state.

Impact:
- Composer/session UI could remain in a streaming/waiting state after the turn had already failed or aborted.

Fix:
- Added `clearStreaming(sessionId)` and clear pending permission state on error/abort; non-permission complete clears streaming.

### 5. Packaged app could create FakeBackend sessions from renderer input

Commit: `778077d Fix runtime failure states and shell permission gaps`

Evidence:
- `apps/desktop/src/main/main.ts` accepted renderer `sessions:create({ backend: 'fake' })` directly.

Impact:
- Packaged app had a fake-session creation path that bypassed the real readiness contract.

Fix:
- Added `canCreateFakeSessionFromRenderer()` and only allow fake sessions in unpackaged dev/visual-smoke contexts.

### 6. Skills were listed but not injected into runtime prompts

Commit: `a4a9b7e Wire skills into prompts and stop parked permissions`

Evidence:
- `skills:list` scanned `{workspaceRoot}/skills/*/SKILL.md`, but `buildSystemPrompt()` only included personalization.

Impact:
- UI made skills look installed, but the model never received their instructions.

Fix:
- Extracted skill scanning/prompt assembly into `apps/desktop/src/main/skills.ts`.
- `buildSystemPrompt()` now includes bounded local skill instructions.
- Prompt fragment explicitly says skills are lower priority, cannot grant tools, cannot bypass permission, and cannot override higher-priority instructions.
- Tests added in `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/skills.test.ts`.

### 7. Stop did not reject parked tool permission requests

Commit: `a4a9b7e Wire skills into prompts and stop parked permissions`

Evidence:
- `AiSdkBackend.stop()` aborted the model stream but did not end the current permission-engine turn.

Impact:
- If a tool was waiting on a permission dialog, Stop could leave the tool wrapper parked until a later user decision.

Fix:
- `stop()` now calls `permissionEngine.endTurn(currentTurnId, 'aborted')`.
- Regression test added in `packages/runtime/src/__tests__/ai-sdk-backend.test.ts`.

### 8. Auto-approved read tools could escape session cwd

Commit: `21522a9 Constrain read tools to session cwd`

Evidence:
- `Read`, `Glob`, and `Grep` were `permissionRequired: false` but accepted absolute paths, `../`, or symlink escapes.

Impact:
- Explore/Ask mode could read files outside the session workspace without a prompt.

Fix:
- `Read` rejects absolute paths and uses lexical + realpath containment under session cwd.
- `Glob` rejects absolute/parent-traversal patterns and constrains optional cwd.
- `Grep` constrains optional path under session cwd.
- Tests added in `packages/runtime/src/__tests__/builtin-tools.test.ts`.

### 9. Main-process stream catch emitted random turn ids

Commit: `1e41f64 Preserve turn ids for stream errors`

Evidence:
- `streamEvents()` catch synthesized renderer error events with `turnId: randomUUID()`.

Impact:
- Even after runtime persisted the correct failed turn, the renderer error event could be detached from the actual turn lineage.

Fix:
- Send/retry/regenerate/quick-chat now generate explicit turn ids and pass them as `fallbackTurnId` into `streamEvents()`.
- Catch uses that id and emits both session and turn status change events.

## Remaining Product / Architecture Findings

### A. Coming Soon settings surfaces still need a product decision

Evidence:
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/settings/SettingsModal.tsx` exposes `daily-review`, `voice-models`, `open-gateway`, and `search` as enabled nav items with Coming Soon copy.
- `packages/core/src/settings.ts` has section ids, but there is no real settings contract for these features yet.

Risk:
- This is honest enough as product-stance copy, but still takes Settings real estate and can feel like shipped capability.

Recommendation:
- @WAWQAQ should choose per page: implement now, hide from nav, or keep as disabled roadmap copy.
- If kept visible, each page needs a real snapshot/status source before it becomes actionable.

### B. Health / Capability center is contract-first, not probe-complete

Evidence:
- `apps/desktop/src/main/capability-snapshot.ts` marks Computer Use, Activity, Voice, Open Gateway, and Memory Write as `not_available` with scaffold reasons.
- Bot readiness is now safer, but most non-bot runtime probes are still placeholders.

Risk:
- UI is no longer lying about operational state, but the actual parity capabilities are not implemented.

Recommendation:
- Next engineering PRs should implement real probes before flipping any row to enabled/operational.
- Computer Use requires real helper process + AX/screenshot probe; Voice requires mic/TTS chunk probe; Open Gateway requires heartbeat.

### C. Prompt assembly still lacks workspace context beyond personalization + skills

Evidence:
- `buildSystemPrompt()` currently joins personalization and installed skills.
- No AGENTS.md / repository instructions / workspace summary is injected.

Risk:
- For coding workflows, the model lacks project-specific rules unless the user repeats them.

Recommendation:
- Add a bounded workspace-instructions loader with containment and precedence rules.
- Treat workspace files as untrusted lower-priority context; include source path and truncation metadata.

### D. Main / renderer / settings / UI component files are still too large

Current sizes:
- `apps/desktop/src/main/main.ts`: 1300 lines
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx`: 1428 lines
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/settings/SettingsModal.tsx`: 1643 lines
- `packages/ui/src/components.tsx`: 2654 lines
- `packages/runtime/src/ai-sdk-backend.ts`: 912 lines

Risk:
- Fixes are harder to isolate; merge conflicts increase; subtle event/state coupling is easy to miss.

Recommendation:
- Split by ownership, not by arbitrary helpers:
  - main IPC: sessions/connections/settings/artifacts/capabilities/skills modules
  - renderer: session event reducer / settings shell / chat shell
  - ui components: chat, sessions, permissions, composer, tool activity modules
  - runtime backend: stream pump, tool wrapper, telemetry/artifact hooks

### E. Open Gateway / search / voice / daily review are still no-op roadmap features

Evidence:
- They have Coming Soon UI copy and capability snapshot placeholders but no backend implementations.

Risk:
- Users may interpret the nav as feature presence.

Recommendation:
- Do not wire buttons/toggles until each has snapshot/degraded/revoke/audit/probe contracts.
- Keep all four behind disabled copy or hide them until implementation starts.
